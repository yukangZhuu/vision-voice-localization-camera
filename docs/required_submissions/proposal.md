### 9.a. Papers

For now, two papers are considered. One for human detection and one for sound source localization.

Human Detection:
YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection
https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934


Sound Source Localization:
Sound localization based on acoustic source using multiple microphone array in an indoor environment.

### 9.b. Datasets

Human Detection: The weights of yolov5.pt are used, which is trained with MS COCO dataset.

### 9.c. Software

We will use Python, Anaconda for virtual environments, Raspberry Pi OS, and YOLOv5.
